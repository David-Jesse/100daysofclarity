# 100daysofclarity

This repository documents my learning of Clarity, a high-level language designed to make it easy to write secure and predictable smart contracts. 
It is a decidable language, meaning that it is designed to be fully verifiable by humans and machines alike. 
This makes it easier to reason about the behavior of a smart contract written in Clarity and to ensure that it behaves as intended.

Clarity is also designed to be easy to learn and use, with a simple syntax that makes it accessible to developers of all skill levels. 
It includes built-in support for features like testing, debugging, and contract composition, making it a powerful tool for building complex applications on the Stacks blockchain.

In this repository I worked on an artist-discography Smart Contract, an NFT marketplace Smart Contract, an advance NFT Smart Contract, a Simple FT token Smart contract,
A Staking Smart Contract, an odds and even smart contract that lets you decide future block parity and an Offspring will Smart Contract. 

These projects have sharpened my Clarity skills, leaving me confident and eager to explore the boundless possibilities it offers.
