# 100daysofclarity

This repository documents my learning of Clarity, a high-level language designed to make it easy to write secure and predictable smart contracts. 
It is a decidable language, meaning that it is designed to be fully verifiable by humans and machines alike. 
This makes it easier to reason about the behavior of a smart contract written in Clarity and to ensure that it behaves as intended.

Clarity is also designed to be easy to learn and use, with a simple syntax that makes it accessible to developers of all skill levels. 
It includes built-in support for features like testing, debugging, and contract composition, making it a powerful tool for building complex applications on the Stacks blockchain.
